An algorithm for decoding neural activity as a method for neurological
control of a hand trajectory. The optimal decoder was developed using Maximum a Posteriori
classification and Kalman filter decoding. The algorithm described was able to reconstruct a 2-D
hand position trajectory from the activity of 98 neurons in the premotor cortex with an accuracy of
98% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.3584.
